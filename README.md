# childspark-web
My project is an online platform that represents a many non-governmental 
organizations focused on children’s welfare. It provides information about the NGO’s 
mission, projects, and impact on children’s lives. The website serves as a hub for fundraising, 
volunteer opportunities, and resources for those interested in supporting or learning more 
about the NGO’s work towards improving the well-being of children. It shows many children 
related websites, so the donors have choices to donate in the NGO they wish to donate in.
